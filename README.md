Java 8 introduced several significant features and enhancements, including lambda expressions, the Stream API, default methods in interfaces, and java.time package for date and time manipulation, and more. Here's a summary of the key features introduced in Java 8:

## Lambda Expressions:

Lambda expressions provide a concise way to represent anonymous functions or closures.
They facilitate functional programming by allowing functions to be passed around as arguments.
Lambda expressions are commonly used with functional interfaces, which have a single abstract method.

## Stream API:

The Stream API provides a powerful way to process collections of objects in a functional style.
It supports operations such as map, filter, reduce, and collect, making it easier to write concise and expressive code for data manipulation.

## Default Methods in Interfaces:

Interfaces can now have default methods, which provide a way to add new methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations.
Default methods have an implementation in the interface itself, which can be overridden by implementing classes if necessary.

## java.time Package:

The java.time package introduces a modern date and time API inspired by Joda-Time.
It provides classes such as LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime, ZonedDateTime, Duration, and Period for representing dates, times, intervals, and durations.

## Optional Class:

The Optional class is a container object that may or may not contain a non-null value.
It helps avoid NullPointerExceptions by forcing the developer to handle the presence or absence of a value explicitly.

## Method References:

Method references provide a shorthand syntax for lambda expressions when calling a method that already exists.
They allow you to refer to a method without executing it.

These are some of the key features introduced in Java 8. They have significantly improved the language, making Java more expressive, concise, and efficient for modern development paradigms.
